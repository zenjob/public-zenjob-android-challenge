Welcome!
===================


This is your Android challenge as part of the Zenjob interview process. This repository should contain all necessary information to solve the tasks. 
As part of your challenge you will develop a simple Android Application in **Kotlin** and an additional library set of your choice.


Challenge Overview
-------------

Our intern created a demo application that fetches a list of movies from an API, shows it and on click opens 
a detail screen for the given movie. Since he just started Android development the project does not follow the 
Android Best Practices or Material Guidelines. 

It is up to you to bring the project and / or UI to a more senior level.

Requirements
-------------

The demo application uses the free [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3). In order to use it you need to create a TMDB Account and add the API Key to the App.


Engineering Requirements
-------------

Feel free to use any frameworks/ libraries / architecture paradigms you want. The project is just a starting point so you can save time and don't have to 
do the basic setup yourself. The only real requirement is to use Kotlin.




Tasks
-------------

**Mandatory tasks:**
1. Make the App runnable, List screen and detail screen should work.
2. Refactor the data handling with a pattern of your choice and write unit test(s) for it.
3. Enhance the Movie List by adding images to the list items
4. Enhance the Detail Screen by adding an image
    
**Optional tasks:** 

*Architecture*
- Setup Dependency Injection

*Features:*
- Add offline support for the list and detail screen
- Implement pagination for the list
- Add deeplink for the detail screen
- Add a share button to the detail screen and implement a basic sharing mechanism
- Improve resiliency of the App by adding error handling

*Tests*
- Add sample UI Tests

*Build System:*
- Improve dependency handling of gradle files
- Migrate to gradle kotlin dsl
- Build project on CI/CD tool of your choice


*Please pick some tasks from the optional task list to your liking or improve the App in any other way and write a few words about what you did.*

**Notes**
- The challenge is time-boxed to a maximum of 4 hours, please be fair to others and your own schedule and try adhere to it
- Focus on what you're good at or what you want to learn anyway, don't get hung up on a task for too long
- Showoff where you can and want :D 

***Good luck and have fun with the challenge!***
